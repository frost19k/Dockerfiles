  <h1>Amass</h1>

Here is where I manage & conduct experiments to improve the Docker Container for [Amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass).

This image differs from the official in two ways
1. It runs `amass` as root inside the container
2. It outputs to `/amass` instead of `/.config/amass`

### Run the container
```bash
‚ùØ docker run -it --rm \
  -v "${PWD}":'/amass/' \
  frost19k/amass enum -d example.com
```
